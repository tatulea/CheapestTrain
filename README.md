# CheapestTrain
Get the cheapest train ticket for a route in a specified interval.

The current script is looking for the route Galsgow - Coventry. This can be changed on lines 31, 32, but you have to know the ID of your stations.

The interval is hardcoded on the lines 45, 46.


# TODO
- add dynamic route based on the name, not the ID
